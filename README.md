# Act2Milkshape
Converts a Genesis3D Actor file (.act) to MilkShape format (.ms3d). This format is supported by Assimp (Open Asset Import Library), which should help load Genesis3D models in any model viewer or game engine. So, if you're looking into this, it should definitely help.

When I have some time, I plan to convert directly to Assimp format instead of using a intermediary format, but this works for me for now.

Thanks to Terry Flanigan (@hgtterry) for his Equity program, which also includes a converter for .ms3d and some other nice features too. It help me a lot to understand how the format works and how the conversions are done.
